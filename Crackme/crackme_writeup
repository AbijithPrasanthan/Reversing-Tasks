CRACKME 0X00a:

For the challenge we have to insert a password and it will show the message. I ran the executable in gdb and disassembled the main function. Examining the code I got to know that it is using strcmp to compare the entered password and the correct password. Using 'x/s' I inspected the variable above the function call and it returned a string "g00dJ0B" and when I gave it as the password it accepted it.

CRACKME 0X04:
The sum of the entered numbers must be 15

CRACKME 0X05:
The sum of entered digits must be 16

CRACKME 0X06,0x07,0x08,0x09:
The sum of the entered digits must be sixteen and also we have to set an environment variable to "LOLO".
So the input should be LOLO=./crackme0x06 and then enter a number whose digits sum up to sixteen.
